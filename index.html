    <h1> I love discovering all the possible solutions to a problem and then figuring out the best fit.</h1>
        <p>Hello, I am Kristen Wilcox, a UX/UI design student and high school art teacher. I specialize in ideation. 
        
        I tell my art students that there is no right answer when creating art and the beauty is in all the possibilities. I remind them that they can grow their skills in judgement to find the best fit for them and learn to find their ‘voice’.</p>
        
       <p> I know that I will bring this philosophy to any team I work with and to any design.  Although I am a natural divergent thinker, I enjoy the process of making an idea attainable and relevant.  I am open to feedback and collaboration and really love working with others to problem-solve.          
        </P>
